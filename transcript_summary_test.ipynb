Frank Slootman   Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc.   Thanks, Jimmy. Welcome and good afternoon. Q2 product revenue grew 37% year -over-year to reach  $640  million. Non -GAAP product gross margin expanded to 78% and non -GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $88  million, representing 50% year -over-year growth. In Q2, we continued to execute in an unsettled macro  environment, but with incremental improvement in  general sentiments and engagement.     Generative AI is at the forefront of customer conversations. However, enterprises are also realizing that they  cannot have an AI strategy without a data strategy to base it on. We have a head start in this race as the  epicenter of highly curated, optimized and trusted enterprise data. We now have a presence with 639 Global 2000  customers.     AI reaches beyond enterprise boundaries. Models need external data to answer challenging questions.     Data Sharing makes Snowflake uni quely positioned to enable AI workloads. As of Q2, 26% of Snowflake  customers are Data Sharing, up from 20% in the same period last year. Approximately 70% of the customers with  more than $1 million in trailing 12 -month product revenue are Data Sharing wit h an average of six stable edges.     For years, we focused on the programmability of our platform via Snowpark. We are seeing momentum. In Q2,  we added more than 400 Snowpark customers and our consumption grew approximately 70% quarter -over- quarter. 63% of o ur Global 2000 customers are using Snowpark on a weekly basis.     Document AI is now in private preview. With Document AI, customers can use natural language to ask questions  of unstructured data. Legal contracts or invoices are now available for inquiry in analytics. This is an early  example of how language models are expanding our opportunity.     With Snowflake Container Services, we are bringing LLM models like Reka and NVIDIA\\'s NeMo into Snowflake.  You heard in my conversation with Jensen, Snowflake is sitt ing on a gold mine of data. Together, we can help  customers turn that gold mine into intelligence.     We announced Snowpark Container Services two months ago. Since then, hundreds of customers have  requested access to the private preview. With our support of  Iceberg Tables, we are expanding our data lake  scope. Many customers already use Snowflake as a data lake. Large financial services customer consolidates  data in Snowflake to eliminate useless extracts in transfers of data. This means new use cases are de ployed 80%  faster.  Snowflake, Inc.  (SNOW )  Q2 2024 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript   23-Aug-2023      1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   5  Copyright © 2001 -2023  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC       Iceberg Tables will bring additional scope and open file formats through Snowflake. We expect to unlock more  data lake opportunities with these capabilities.     We\\'ve also reached an inflection point on the application front. At Summit, w e launched so -called Native Apps in  public preview. We have over 25 native application providers today. Snowflake is a safe, certified and sanctioned  place to deploy applications. Grassroots support is building. We now have more than 145,000 monthly active   developers on Streamlit. This represents an increase of 160% year -on-year. Our start -up program allocates  resources to developers planning to build on Snowflake. Approximately 20% of new customers landed in Q2  landed on Snowflake through our startup progr am.    General sentiment appears to be incrementally getting better. Our Snowflake Summit in June was highlight of  energy and excitement about what is becoming possible in the world of data. We hosted over 20,000 onsite and  virtual attendees. This was up ove r 85% from last year. Next up is our Data Cloud World Tour. The World Tour  brings Summit messaging to a wider audience. We expect to double the attendance of Summit. This is in 26 cities  worldwide.     With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P . Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.   Thank you, Frank. Consumption came in line with our expectations for the quarter. In May, we saw a return to  growth with strength continuing into June and July. From a booking standpoint, we saw promising signs of  stabilization with new bookings outperforming our expectations. However, we believe productivity has room for  further improvement.     Q2 remaining performance obligations grew 30% year -over-year, totaling $3.5 billion. Of the $3.5 billion in RPO,  we expect approximately 57% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. This represents a 32%  increase compared to our estimate as of the same quarter last year.     Our net revenue retention rate of 142% includes six new customers with $1 mill ion in trailing 12 -month product  revenue. We now have 402 customers with trailing 12 -month product revenue greater than $1 million. We  continue to focus on growth and efficiency. We generated $88 million in non -GAAP adjusted free cash flow,  outperforming o ur Q2 target.     Q2 represented another quarter of continued progress on profitability. Our non -GAAP product gross margin was  77.9%, benefiting from a onetime credit from one of our cloud service providers. Non -GAAP operating margin was  8%, benefiting from t ight controls on head count additions and the overachievement in product gross margin. Our  non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 13%. We continue to have a strong cash position with $4.9 billion  in cash, cash equivalents and short -term and long -term investments. We did not repurchase any shares in the  quarter, but plan to opportunistically repurchase shares using our free cash flow.     Now let\\'s turn to guidance. Our forecast assumes that our largest customers will continue to be a growth  headwind. We a re seeing encouraging signs of stabilization, but not recovery. Our forecast calls for these  customers to more closely align their consumption with their annual contract value. For the third quarter, we  expect product revenues between $670 million and $675  million, representing year -over-year growth between  28% and 29%.    Snowflake, Inc.

For the full year fiscal 2024, we expect produc t revenues of approximately  $2.6 billion, representing year -over-year growth of approximately 34%.

With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....    QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION      Operator : Absolutely. We will now begin the question -and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first  question will be from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Keith Weiss   Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q  Thanks a lot. Thank you for taking the question, guys. Mike, I wanted to dig into the comment about kind of the  large customer activity. You talked to us about sort o f consumption coming more in line with the committed  contracts. Can you give us any visibility what\\'s happening on the contract renewals? Because as you go through  these big contract renewals, are you seeing any change in their behavior of what the large c ustomers are willing  to commit to? And any impacts that we should be thinking about on how that\\'s going to impact bookings and sort  of RPO on a go -forward basis?    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Yes. No, we\\'re seeing custo mers renew. This quarter was a good renewal quarter. We had our largest customer.  They renewed under their existing terms. They did $100 million three -year renewal, even though their revenue run  rate is at a higher amount than that. I think we did 9 or 10 $10 million -plus TCV deals this quarter and most of  those were renewals. And so, customers are doing that. But remember, that doesn\\'t necessarily equate to  consumption. And we do know some of our largest customers are trying to consume at their contract ra te rather  than going above that.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Keith Weiss   Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q  Got it. So, the dynamic is really on consumption if it\\'s not on contracting as of yet?    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  No, it\\'s on consumption. As I said, the contracting actually feels – the sentiment really seemed to change in July  with customers really reengaging with us. And I think we\\'ll have good bookings, but that doesn\\'t equate to  consumption. It takes time for the consumption  to come in.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

LLC  Q  Got it. Got it. And if I could sneak one in for Frank as well. You talked about you need a good data strategy to  have a good AI strategy, and that\\'s something we hear a lot when we\\'re talking to customers and people out there  in the field. So that really resonates. When it comes to kind of go -to-market and sort of the selling motion, does  having to have the Gen AI conversation, while a long -term positive, does that disrupt the sort of typical k ind of  Data Cloud discussion that you guys have been having for the past like five years with these customers, does it  risk or has it been elongating the sales cycles in any real way?    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Frank Slootman   Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  No, I wouldn\\'t say so, Keith. I think we were actually saying that having highly organized, optimized, trusted,  sanctioned data is incredibly important for deploying large language models. If you think you can just drop a  model on top of a data lake and ju st see what happens, that\\'s not going to end well. And that\\'s what people are  realizing. So they really got to get super serious about their foundations before we – if you don\\'t have a good  foundation, there\\'s not much you can build on top of that. There\\'s  tons of governance issues involved as well. We  spent literally decades as an industry making data highly governed. In other words, who can have access to what.  So that now needs to translate into the world of large language models as well.     So there\\'s tons of questions that are coming up that are really important for the enablement of language models in  AI generally. So being extremely organized on your data is going to become a premium thing. And then we\\'re  obviously that\\'s – we\\'ve been on that, but it \\'s become more important as a function of this.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Keith Weiss   Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q  Got it. Yeah, it definitely resonates with the conversation we\\'re having as well. So thank you very much for the  time, guys.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....     Operator : Thank you. The next  question will be from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is now  open.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Mark R. Murphy   Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC  Q  Yes. Thank you very much. Frank, I\\'m wondering if you can speak to the expanded Microsoft relationship. I  believe you referred to it as nearly a doubling of the commitment. And I\\'m wondering if you\\'re optimistic on seeing  that alignment in the field coming together and perhaps unlocking some new opportunities relating to Azure or  even some of the OpenAI workloads that you  wouldn\\'t have seen previously. And then I have a quick follow -up. .   ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Frank Slootman   Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Yeah. Look, the bottom line of working with the cloud vendors is not what gets set at the top levels, the good  intentions. What matters is what are the incentives, when you get 14 layers down at street level, how do we get  people get paid. That determines whether they\\'re either going to fight you and double and triple down on that or  they\\'re going to partner with you. And we see models where we\\'ve worked out really, really well, of course, with  AWS, but with Microsoft, we were not in the place that we wanted to be at street level in terms of the incentives.    Snowflake, Inc.  (SNOW )  Q2 2024 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript   23-Aug-2023      1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   8  Copyright © 2001 -2023  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC     So we really took this opportunity when we were renegotiating our relationship with Microsoft to say, hey, we have  to tackle this, right? And Microsoft very much wanted to be a bigger percentage of our business because they\\'re  not punching at their weight at all. They\\'re not as big a percentage of our business as the y should be based on  our market share and they want to be. And this is the way to do it. It\\'s really you need to bring alignment to the  field organizations, then you\\'re going to get partnerships and then you\\'re going to get joint selling and then you\\'re  going to get your fair share.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Mark R. Murphy   Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC  Q  Okay. Thank you for that. And Mike, as a follow -up, in Q2, did you observe any customers adjusting or indexing or  reducing data retention time lines? It looks like the quarter  went well overall. But I\\'m curious if you sense any  more or less of that optimization activity heading into the second half here?    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  In terms of customers changing their retention policy, we really didn\\'t notice any of that. If anything, we saw  growth in the amount of storage in the quarter. And I just want to call out, that was really one large customer that  changed their retention from five to three years, that was pretty unusual. And in ter ms of optimizations, we  continually work with customers on their own optimizations, but we\\'re continuing to optimize our software as well,  too, because we are really dedicated to delivering price performance for our customers. And I want to stress,  we\\'ve b een talking about optimizations with investors since we went public. These will always continue,  optimizations, whether it\\'s customer or us doing the optimizations, because when – history has shown when we  improve price performance, more workloads come to us.   ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Mark R. Murphy   Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC  Q  Thank you very much.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....     Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is now  open.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Kirk Materne   Analyst, Evercore ISI  Q  Yeah. Thanks very much. Mike, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the comment you\\'re  seeing stabilization in consumption, but not recovery. I\\'m just kind of curious, when you say that, is that the  pressure from the top -down on practitioners s tarting to ease a little bit and they\\'re starting to feel better about  what they can consume, and there\\'s waiting for budgets to kind of get refreshed to sort of get going on the  recovery side? I\\'m just kind of curious if it\\'s sort of the top -down easing o r it\\'s more that they\\'re taking a little while  to sort of ramp back up on projects that perhaps they slowed down six months ago, three months ago?    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  I actually think it\\'s both, but I definite ly think the fact that we kind of saw customers more reengaging with us in  July on contracts, and that continues into this quarter. I think it is easing a little bit at the top level in terms of  approvals for customers and they\\'re willing to commit. But it  takes time to convert that to consumption with – as I  said, consumption is good. It was really good today as an example, but that\\'s only one data point. It\\'s – we want Snowflake, Inc.  (SNOW )  Q2 2024 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript   23-Aug-2023      1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   9  Copyright © 2001 -2023  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC     to see more days of that before we think the – we\\'re into a real recovery. I think stab ilization is the right term.  We\\'re not seeing customers reduce their consumption right now.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Kirk Materne   Analyst, Evercore ISI  Q  Okay. And then, Frank, just as you spoke to a lot of executives at Summit, do they recognize the fact that the road  to AI does require perhaps a heavier levels of investment than they were thinking 12 months ago? How do you  think that factors into sort of their thinking on budgets as we go into 2024? Thanks.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Frank Slootman   Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Yeah. The reality is they don\\'t really know yet in any real definitive terms what this is going to take. I mean, I think  a lot of people, I think this correct, they have characterized their foray into language models as experimental,  exploratory and so rt of trying to get their arms around how big a bread box is this. So it\\'s going to take a while  before we get a real read on what the level of investment is that people are going to stomach to do this. I mean,  one of the challenges – one of the great thin gs about search historically has been that search also had a very  potent business model to go with it to pay for it. And we cannot sort of unleash AI and have no business model to  pay for and people will get tired, they\\'re really, really quick.     So these a re – but these GPUs from NVIDIA, they aren\\'t cheap as powerful as they are. So we all have to bring  that into alignment and into focus and have a sensible go -forward strategy. So, a lot of the use cases will focus on  what are we getting for this, right? Th is is not just fun and games and planning your next trip to Yellowstone and  people are going to be asking very, very hard -hitting questions, what is this doing for us?    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Kirk Materne   Analyst, Evercore ISI  Q  Thank you.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....     Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now  open.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Raimo Lenschow   Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.  Q  Yes. Thank you. Great to see the stabilization as well from my end. Congrats there. Frank, one for you more is, as  you – as we all realize that data is kind of the new fuel, we do see more window dressing like, oh, no, I have the  data, I have the data, which kind of in a way like kind of puts them on a slightly different course than it used to be  compared to your partner ship. How do you see that competitive landscape evolving for you since you in theory  are the natural kind of holding source for data that is used in AI? How do you see this playing out for you guys?  Thank you.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Frank Slootman   Chairman & Chief Executive Of ficer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Well, we see it play out really well. I think we agree with you. I mean, we think that data is becoming infinitely  valuable, and that\\'s for all kinds of reasons because we can no longer run enterprises and institutions based on  what we call anecdotal observation, because the world is too dynamic, too disruptive, and we have this massive Snowflake, Inc.  (SNOW )  Q2 2024 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript   23-Aug-2023      1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   10  Copyright © 2001 -2023  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC     disintermediation happening. We no longer have all these intermediaries between us and the end customer. You  can only run direct -to-consumer busine sses with data.     I mean, you see that, for example, in insurance, like auto industry, companies like GEICO and then Progressive  and Liberty Mutual. I mean, you can only run these businesses on top of data, telemetry data being really  important. And we thin k every business, every institutions is going to develop a complete and total dependency,  not just on data, but the ability to harness that data. So this is a full -on transformation really of how industry and  institutions have operated. And we\\'re at the le ading edge of it, but we\\'re also very much at the beginning of it.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Raimo Lenschow   Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.  Q  Okay. Thank you.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....     Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Your line is now open.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Karl E. Keirstead   Analyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q  Thank you. So, Mike, just one – maybe two quickies. You mentioned there was a one -time credit from one of the  CSPs. Are you able to define how material that was? It sounds like it might have certainly hit gr oss margins, but  just wanted to clarify.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  That was about $4 million that hit in the quarter.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Karl E. Keirstead   Analyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q  Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe just a follow -up, Mike, what I\\'m hearing you describe is an effort,  you mentioned certainly your largest customer, but perhaps others taking their usage a little bit closer to their  ACV. So one would think that, that would result in a decent amount of head wind. Yet your guidance for the third  quarter, in my judgment anyway, is relatively solid. So what\\'s the offset? What customer segment might be  ramping nicely to offset to some extent the headwinds from your large customers? Thanks so much.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Sc arpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Well, we\\'re now at 639 Global 2000 customers that are only consuming on average on a trailing 12 -months at  around $1.5 million, $1.6 million. A lot of those are still doing their migrations, and we don\\'t see that stopping. It\\'s  the larger customers. They just are not forecast to grow as quickly. They\\'re still growing, but at a slower pace.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Karl E. Keirstead   Analyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q  Yes, Okay.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  That could – once again, this is a consumption model. That could turn around tomorrow.  Snowflake, Inc.

Keirstead   Analyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q  Yes. I get it. Okay. Thank you, Mike.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....     Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line  of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is  now open.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Kash Rangan   Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC  Q  Thank you so much. Frank, I think your fireside chat with Jensen was absolutely illuminating. He was looking at  the opportunity set with structured  data in the Snowflake ecosystem and almost salivating. And yet you seemed a  little moderated and that you need to have a business case. So, when are we likely to reach the point where  generative AI, coupled with Snowpark, could really lead to a tangible i ncrease in consumption outside of the core  Data Cloud business?     And one for you, Mike. If we were to read your comments, three months of stability, four months of stability, it  looks like including August, does that mean that net expansion rates reach a b ottom and could potentially start to  stabilize and rebound as we head into the later part of the year. Thank you so much.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Frank Slootman   Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Well, this is Frank, Kash. I mean, in the really short term, I \\'m really talking days, weeks and months here, where  you are going to see language model begin to immediately impact the business is that SQL generation. I mean, in  other words, the analyst job is going to be up levelled so much. I mean, people are going t o be able to drive  queries into the data much better, much faster with far less skill requirement than they ever had before. And we\\'re  showing that off every day.     So I mean, these days, you don\\'t even have to be literate in order to be able to have intera ctions with your data.  So that really is an expansion vector that is just enormously – and it\\'s very close to home because it\\'s really how  you use data and how you use a platform like Snowflake.     The other area where you\\'re going to see drivers of workload  is that people get to search for data related to what  their general angle of inquiry is in a much more effective manner than they had been able before. And this is also  where it\\'s very important that you can search beyond enterprise boundaries because the  context of data is not  limited by your enterprise boundaries.     We can go on and on and on about use cases. There\\'s a million of them. If you get further down, you could start  asking really, really hard questions that in prior periods, prior eras, we reall y needed to launch whole analyst  teams to go research and investigate topics where now the data will be able – or the systems will be able to  generate queries in the type of data that will immediately very, very quickly begin to generate insights. And that \\'s  – by the way, that\\'s going to become the leading edge for structured proprietary data, which is, of course, the  center of our universe.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

And on your question on net revenue retentio n, I just want to remind you, I\\'m not going to guide to net  revenue retention. But I do think over time, it is going to continue to converge closer to our growth rate. I do think  it will stabilize, but I do expect it\\'s going to come down slightly from wher e it\\'s at right now just on what we\\'re  seeing today.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....     Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is  now open.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Brad Zelnick   Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q  Great. Thank you so much. I\\'ve got one for Frank and one for Mike. Frank, stable edges continue to tick up, which  is great to see, and I know it\\'s an important metric for the company and its strategic vision. Anything else perhaps  qualitative that you can share in terms of ho w Data Sharing is progressing?     And for you, Mike, great to see the margin upside, everybody\\'s happy about it, but with such a huge opportunity,  how can you be sure you\\'re striking the right balance of investment, especially when you\\'re up against such wel l- capitalized competitors? Thanks, guys.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Frank Slootman   Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Yeah. On the topic of Data Sharing, we instrument that whole side of the business very, very carefully, and we  drive it on a quarterly basis, b ut sometimes data edges are very enterprise -specific. In other words, they do have  things – the use cases that just pertain to their business. And it\\'s – these are bilateral relationships between  Snowflake accounts and different institutions.     But what get s really interesting, where you get real network effect kicking in is when you have industries or sub - industries where data sharing just makes sense. And obviously, in financial institutions, because financial  institutions inherently have been pumping date  around at a massive, massive of volumes for literally for  generations.     This is an absolute no -brainer. And we do the vast majority historically data edges have been in the financial  services sector. It\\'s become almost a standard. This is how we data from  A to B to C, asset management,  particularly has a really big need for that. But the other area – and again, this is an industry in supply chain  management.     In the supply chain, there are multiple entities to the degree that they all have Snowflake accoun ts, it\\'s very easy  to get visibility in the supply chain across entities and being able to flag supply chain events much earlier and get  visibility to that. So once you\\'re in a supply chain, they need to be on Snowflake and share data with your supply  chain partners is going to become very, very compelling.     And we announced at Summit and even earlier, our relationship with Blue Yonder, for example, who is really the  largest software company in the world of supply chain management that they are replatformin g on Snowflake. So  we think that\\'s another sort of industry/sub -industry where every manufacturer, every retailer is going to become  an opportunity there for us. So, just a little bit of color on how these things develop from our perspective.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

You did see the guided margins to 4% for operating margin, where we just did 5% this quarter.  And that\\'s because we\\'re investing as an example, we have 1,000 H100 GPUs reserve. That\\'s an extra $1 million  a month as we\\'re working on AI.     I\\'m not getting requests that people need more head count in the engineering organizati on. The sales and  marketing, until we see an increase in productivity, we\\'re going to be very methodical about how we add  resources into those areas. So, we\\'re definitely not under -investing in the business. I\\'m not getting the feedback  from any of the exe cutive team with regards to that.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Brad Zelnick   Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Your line is now open.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Tyler Radke   Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.  Q  Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. First question just on the commentary around some of the projects you\\'re  starting to see better momentum there, particularly in July.     I was wondering if you could just commen t on the nature of those projects. Are they larger deals than you typically  see or maybe they include more generative AI or data science, given all the new products that you released? If  you could just kind of contrast the pickup and kind of where that\\'s c oming from?    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Frank Slootman   Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Yeah. Just – do you want to go...    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  You go ahead, Frank.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Frank Slootman   Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  So, you shouldn\\'t equate projects with deals, okay, because there\\'s tons and tons of projects going on and the  projects we relate to use cases and workloads and applications. And what we said in the prepared remarks is  we\\'ve rea lly seen a sort of a sentiment change from the early quarters where people were sort of trying to cut off  their limbs to fit within budgetary constraint and all this kind of stuff and where – that\\'s where you see unnatural  acts to save money. That has real ly subsided considerably. And the conversation has really gone back to where it  historically has been, is we want to do these applications, these workloads, these migrations. And of course, we\\'re  pushing the boundaries on the much more sophisticated use ca ses in machine learning. And obviously, people  want to understand how do I deploy large language models on a Snowflake platform.

Q  Great. And then a follow -up, just in terms of the Snowpark revenue, any update on kind of where you\\'re expecting  that to track as you exit this year? And then these related services, whether it\\'s the Native App store or Container  Services, would that all fall under Snowpark theoretically when that goes GA next year? Thank you.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  In terms of Snowpark, as we said, we\\'re – Frank talked about seeing 70% growth in Snowpark consumption. It\\'s  still relatively small, but meaningful. We have a number of customers that are in the process of doing their  migrations, a few quite large ones. I do think next year, it will be more meaningful to revenue. But on $2.6 billion in  revenue, it\\'s a couple percent of our revenue this year.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Frank Slootman   Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Once Container Services become primetime and that is p art of Snowpark, obviously, that means any workload  that comes to our game to be deployed on Snowflake. This is obviously, running close to the data inside our  governance perimeter, it\\'s essentially virtualization for the cloud. So we think there is enormo us upside for us  once those services become generally available across all our cloud platforms.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

Your line is now open.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Brent Thill   Analyst, Jefferies LLC  Q  Mike, you mentioned at the Analyst Day, you were idling back quota -carrying sales capacity on the new hire front.  Have you seem any different to lean back into hiring quota reps in 2023?    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  It really depends upon the territory and the opportunity. There are some territories where – kind of  regions we\\'re  shrinking where it\\'s overcapacity, and we\\'re reshifting those heads to other more productive territories as we\\'re –  I\\'m not planning on adding net a lot of new ones for the balance of this year. But as we\\'re starting to plan for next  year, t here is additional head count going into the quota -carrying rep area.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

And for Frank, on the vertical side, any verticals that are showing more excitement that perhaps weren\\'t  online, that weren\\'t firing up? Ar e you seeing anything change here?    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Frank Slootman   Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Actually, that\\'s a great question because we had massive outperformance by our healthcare vertical this quarter  and healthcare usually runs fourth or  fifth in the lineup of verticals and they massive outperformed – really excited  about – it feels like that healthcare is really getting a move on, if you will. They have not traditionally been an  aggressive adopter of technology. But, in the world of data , they are moving, they\\'re moving hard and you see it  on the provider side, you see it on the payer side, you see it on the pharma side. So I think that\\'s going to become  a great contributing segment for us.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Yes. Healthcare and Life Sciences grew 61% year -over-year in revenue for us.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Frank Slootman   Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Yeah. [indiscernible] (00:40:31).    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

Your line is  open.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael Turrin   Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q  Hi. Great. Thanks. Appreciate you taking the questions. I think one of the comments mentioned new bookings  outperformed expectations. I appreciate you\\'re still seeing room for improvement, but anything you can add  around what drove the im provement versus last quarter, it sounded like Healthcare from the prior commentary,  but wondering if some other or certain product releases maybe also contributed there?    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Yes. Hard to say whether it was – I don\\'t think it was a product release. I would say we saw some nice renewals  from customers with growth. We also saw two very large Cap ones, one large one in Europe, which was – Cap  One is an initial deal, it was a $22 million TCV deal i n an insurance industry and we saw a large gaming company  in Korea commit to $9.5 million as a Cap One. So clearly, our message is getting across to these customers, and  they see what we\\'re doing and a lot of these want to do more in the area of AI. But fi rst, they need to get their data Snowflake, Inc.

It\\'s not going to happen overnight, AI for our  customers. .    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael Turrin   Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC  Q  Like and appreciate those large deal stats.  Maybe just quickly on the back half. If you can just help level set  what\\'s embedded in the rest of the year outlook. We\\'ve seen multiple comments around stabilization. It\\'s not fairly  consistent with what informs the outlook and maybe just any refresh on second half seasonality as expected.  Thank you.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Well, Q4 is usually one of our largest bookings quarter and it\\'s shaping up, but that\\'s not necessarily consumption.  And – but the sentiment within our sales team has definitely shifted from where it was in the first half of the year.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

Patrick Colville   Analyst, Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.  Q  All right. Thank you so much for taking my question. I just want to double -click on your comments. I think you said  customers are reengaging in July. You said that  in the prepared remarks. I mean, I guess, what do you mean by  that? Is that new customers, existing customers, consumption, contract negotiations? And then any color you can  give us on thus far in August would be helpful.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Fina ncial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  All three of the above. We have new customers. I just pointed out those two large Cap Ones, we usually don\\'t do  Cap Ones that big, and it was a very good quarter with some large new customers. We\\'re seeing our existing  customers. We saw some nice early renewals with customers where they were consuming faster. And we\\'re  seeing customers willing to do larger deals rather than just do a co -term to bridge them through to another period.  So that\\'s what I mean by the sentiment  is changing with our customers.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Patrick Colville   Analyst, Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.  Q  All right. I guess my kind of follow -up is, I mean, NVIDIA reported results tonight. I think looking at their numbers, I  mean, data center revenue rose about 150% se quentially. But clearly, like AI spend is hitting the silicon layer. I  mean, a question I get from investors is when will AI spend more clearly hit the software layer. I mean, do you  have any thoughts on that?    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

As I said, it\\'s going to take some time for AI and people are still struggling to get  GPUs and there is a time lag between when a chip manufacturer sells their chips to it gets built into the hardwar e  that actually gets deployed in a rack in a data center and it gets deployed to customers.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Frank Slootman   Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  I think you will see the leading action of that happening in months to come. But the material impact, I think most  analysts out there are seeing there is a 2024 thing and we tend to agree with that.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  And I would say in my prior life, when we were buying racks and servers, th ere\\'s a six month delay between when  we bought them and when they were actually going into production. And I don\\'t see that...    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

Thank you, Frank.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolf Research. Your line is now  open.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Ethan Bruck   Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q  Hey, guys. This is Ethan  Bruck on for Alex Zukin. I just had a quick kind of numbers question. So, if we calculate  the product revenue or cRPO booking growth, it decelerated to 13% from about 30% last quarter. So just curious,  how should we think about this as an indicator of fut ure consumption for future product growth?    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  So, I guided to full year revenue at $2.6 billion, and we\\'ll guide next year next year.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Ethan Bruck   Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q  Okay. And then I guess just to ask the August trends question in a different way. I guess, has some of the stability  you called out trended into August kind of the first month of the quarter? And then just on the seasonality, is there  any kind of month to note as yo u think about the rest of the year, like that either is seasonally strong, seasonally  weak?    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

I called out yesterday, it was actually a very g ood consumption,  but one day doesn\\'t make a trend. Q4 is definitely seasonality with the holidays with Thanksgiving in the US and  the Christmas holidays that does impact daily consumption. From a bookings perspective, Q4 though, is clearly  our largest book ings.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Ethan Bruck   Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q  Got it. Got it. Make sense. Okay.

Operator : Thank you. Your next question will be from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Your line is  now open.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Brent A. Bracelin   Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.  Q  Thank you. I wanted to go back to the discussion around the increase we\\'re seeing in model training capacity.  Clearly, billions of incremental dollars going into NVIDIA GPUs here, you need data to train the  models. I  appreciate there\\'s going to be a lag relative to when the spend hits the data layer. But are there any technical  hurdles that need to be overcome? Or do you think this cycle is different in that there are other considerations as  well? Just think ing through that the investment we\\'re seeing right now in infrastructure and thinking through what  are the other factors we need to think about before it starts to impact the data layer. Thanks.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Frank Slootman   Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflak e, Inc.  A  I\\'ll start, and then maybe Christian can follow, even think about your question while I\\'m talking. You can\\'t  characterize this AI as one thing, right, because you see the things that people are doing with unstructured data  and the whole notion of co -pilots and the systems and tutors and all that. It\\'s very much focused on contextual  data. And we see action with support call records, contact centers and so on. But again, you look at Snowflake,  who sits on mountains of structured proprietary enter prise data that\\'s a different [indiscernible] (00:48:23) for AI  than the very text model -oriented type of inquiry.     And I have to say that just from all my conversation with customers, I mean people are ensuring, I would say, the  textual side [indiscernibl e] (00:48:42) with proprietary data, how they\\'re going to approach that. We view that as  our business, and we\\'re driving that very hard. And hence the emphasis on getting your data [indiscernible]  (00:48:53) in order because you just cannot unleash large l anguage model and hope for the best, because of all  the issues that we\\'ve mentioned before around governance and just understanding of what kind of data we are  generating in the process. That\\'s why I said the early going, you\\'re going to see a lot of upsid e from AI that the  analysts are going to be able to generate data far quicker, far better than they ever have been before. And we\\'re  really massively reducing the skill sophistication requirements to be able to do that. That in and of itself is going to  be a big driver for us.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Christian Kleinerman   Senior Vice President -Product, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Yes. So, Christian here, I would add maybe two areas in addition to what Frank mentioned. The first one is  around having the right data to be fed into these mode ls. Frank started the call with no AI strategy without data  strategy. And it is very [ph] important (00:49:49) that the results of traditional ML or Gen AI is a function of having  the right data, the right data quality, the right metrics. The technology wi ll be as good as the data that is fed in.    Snowflake, Inc.

The  other piece that I think will be a technical imperative for everyone doing AI and Gen AI is aroun d the  measurement and feedback, how good are the solutions? How do I know if there are potential bias into the data  or are there gaps in their understanding and performance of the model? Those two are inherent parts of the life  cycle and, interestingly, th ey all run to having a great data foundation enabled service.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Brent A. Bracelin   Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.  Q  Helpful color. And then lastly for Mike on consumption, one follow -up. The implied Q4 product growth is, I think,  26% at the midpoint. I know there\\'s a delta between signing growth and consumption. Exiting this year, do you  think product growth stabilizes in the mid -20% range, maybe starts to reaccelerate next year, or is it just too early  to tell?    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer,  Snowflake, Inc.  A  Let us finish Q3, and then we\\'ll guide to Q4 and I\\'ll see how next year is looking, but I do anticipate – there\\'s a lot  of new things coming out next year that we think are going to have a very positive impact on our consumption  from, r emember, we have Streamlit goes into GA, Unistore towards the end of this year.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  [indiscernible] (00:51:26) public preview. We have containerized services next year. There\\'s a number of things  that are happening that are all going to have a positive impact on our revenue growth rate next year.

Brad Reback   Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.  Q  Great. Thanks very much. Gentlemen, you\\'ve ta lked about changing sentiment a couple of times during the call.  How much of that is your sales team being better able to engage with the customers selling value, just looking at  the problem from a different perspective given the macro trends versus custom ers just feeling better about their  businesses and the macro unleashing the demand? Thanks.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Frank Slootman   Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  It\\'s Frank. Look, it\\'s not the sales team. [ph] There\\'s (00:52:27) really a change in how customers engage a  couple of quarters ago. And like I said earlier, people were doing unnatural acts to force that themselves into a Snowflake, Inc.

The expectation on that reset, we  obviously felt  that. The change in sentiment is that that has passed. We are now sort of, okay, we\\'re comfortable  with the path that we\\'re on.     Now, we\\'re talking again of our projects and migrations and use cases. We\\'re trying to basically get a grip on  deploying large  language models, what do we have to do with the data, with the infrastructure, answering  governance questions and so on. So in other words, the sentiment is very constructive and engaging on core data  strategy. That\\'s a big change from where we were a cou ple of quarters ago. Obviously, the sales people are  perceiving that as very positive, that\\'s [ph] where you (00:53:25) want to be.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

Your line is now  open.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Derrick Wood   Analyst, TD Cowen  Q  Thanks. Mike, this was the strongest sequential growth quarter you\\'ve had in three quarters. I think you were at  6% and 6%, and this was 8.5%. Your guidance for Q3 is kind of 5.5% sequential. I\\'m sure there\\'s some level of  conservatism in there. But just in terms of the Q2, were there any kind of one -time consumption dynamics to call  out? Or does that just really kind of inform us that the optimization headwinds that you saw in Q4 and Q1 kind of  dissipated in Q2?    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Michael P. Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Yeah. Q2 has more days in it. Remember where consumption model was actually a 5% quarter -over-quarter  working days  adjusted was the growth rate. And actually, Q3, it goes up when you look at the working days in Q3.  Remember, on a consumption model, where really kind of 70% is the scheduled work. There is a big piece that is  tied to workdays that does have an impact. S o there is growth next quarter in that guide...    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Derrick Wood   Analyst, TD Cowen  Q  Okay.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

A  ...on a days adjusted basis working days.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Derrick Wood   Analyst, TD Cowen  Q  Okay. Frank or Christian, I just – I was hoping to double -click on the new Container Services. It seems like it  enables you to deploy different types of third -party engines, apps, code bases directly in the platform, you can  streamline a lot more workflows, which, I thin k when it comes to building AI model, seems pretty interesting. So I Snowflake, Inc.  (SNOW )  Q2 2024 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript   23-Aug-2023      1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   21  Copyright © 2001 -2023  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC     was just curious, what are you most excited about in terms of this new capability and opening up new  consumption, especially when it comes to AI?    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....   Frank Slootman   Chairman & Chief Executi ve Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  Yeah. Container Services was the absolute hit, star performer at our Snowflake Summit conference, I mean,  customers were just mesmerized by the possibilities that a platform capability has, because we have essentially  eliminated any limitation on deployment on Snowflake.     And why do you care? I mean, the thing is, first of all, you want to deploy close to the data for all the reasons that  we talk about. This enabled us, you get a fully trusted, sanctioned platform where  you can deploy applications  without any further questions.     I mean, one of the challenges that you have in cloud computing is, who\\'s managing this, right? I mean, what is the  safe space to deploy into? And who is really guaranteeing the high -trust enterprise -grade capabilities of that  platform?     So we are bringing that. So, we\\'re going to see a lot of services, a lot of them could be on -premise legacy engines  that are going to be containerized and [ph] re -serviced (00:56:38) as a cloud service, righ t? So a lot of things that  were old will be new again.     So the – it\\'s virtualization for the cloud and having secure, safe, high performance, very, very efficient spaces to  run services and applications in. So, the sky is the limit on this capability, and we and our customers and our  partners could not be more excited about the potentials and the possibilities here.     But specific to AI and this matters a whole lot, because the containers [ph] are vehicle or (00:57:16) vessel, if you  will, to deploy large la nguage models, there\\'s no limit on which models and how many models and for which  segments of the business we can deploy.     And we can shift gears very, very quickly. And we have incredible flexibility in terms of deploying these  capabilities, because you\\'r e going to see a lot of change and a lot of movement. We\\'ve already seen an  enormous amount that\\'s going to continue. So we\\'re very, very well -positioned architecturally platform -wise to  enable the AI revolution with Container Services.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

Scarpelli   Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.  A  I think in general, our execution in Q2 on the sales side was actually quite good. It improved. But there\\'s still  pockets though, where there is room for improvement when you  look in certain territories or geos.     We have a new leader in EMEA. EMEA – certain markets in EMEA are doing good; others, there\\'s a lot of room  for improvement. We have a new leader in EMEA. There are certain pockets in Asia that are doing good, but  there\\'s others that have a lot of room for improvement, so. But in general, overall, as I talked about, you can see  through our bookings, it was a good execution from a bookings perspective in the aggregate last quarter.    ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....
